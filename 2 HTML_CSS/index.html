        <h1>Welcome to my CSS Demo</h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
            alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
            fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation</p>

        <h1>Independence Day Celebration</h1>
        <p>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a national holiday in India commemorating the
            nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the 1947
            Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came
            into effect. India retained King George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the
            nation adopted the Constitution of India on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced
            the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India
            attained independence following the Independence Movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil
            disobedience.</p>
